<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Isuma Michelle, I am 27 years old. 
  I am Nigerian and I live in poland.
I studied Public health for my first degree and now, instead of a masters , I am going through nursing school.
I have always wanted to work in the medical field not just to help people and the monetery independence it brings, but i always keep in mind that everyone deseves an act of kindness with everything we all go through in life.
I personally feel workig in the medical field is a selfish act because we the professionals relish in the joy of helping others. It truly brings peace to our soul knowing that someone else has joy and doesnt feel alone in troubled times.
Being able express our generousity in this cold world,truly is a blessing to us and the people we care for.</p>

<p>Why the shift into tech?
  I am breaking into tech out of curiosity,
  As a female child back in the day, not so much is expected of you. Just get an education,  be domesticated and get married.
  I was'nt seen as smart talkless of intelligent enough.
  While my brothers would go to computer shcools or be allowed to use the laptop or computer , i realized early what where i should be.
  Leaving home has made me want to discover myself in my entirety. The creative side (i even dabbled into painting for a bit), emotional side(learning and unlearning habits) ,
  here we are with my intelligent side(are you truly dumb or you just dont know and when you find out do you know?). I am very versatile and dont like to be tied down to anything,
  i also dont like monotony so it makes me learn new things too.
 
  Tech has been viewd as only the smartest people achievements but i beg to differ, i am not the smartest person in the world, but i sure am inquisitive, determined and a hard worker all the same.
  I love to know why things are the way they are, i find it intresting, i love to see the beauty of the underlying works of a projcet or the existence of a thing. 
  The creativity, mind and heart put into something before it's made successful.
  I just love it. Also this whole idea that we should look for wealthy men to latch onto bores me, I love the freedom money brings and not being tied down to anyone.
  I can be anything i want to be.

<p>I actully enjoy learning how to become a developer, it reminds me that nothing is hard and we have everything we need in life to be anything we want to be.
  Hence we are limitless.
